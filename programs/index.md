# Programs at the Inquiry Institute
A quick guide to our core pedagogical forms. Each path offers a different way to practice inquiry and make ideas come alive.

## Symposium
The Institute’s solar form of discourse: structured talks, guided dialogue, and communal reasoning.

## Debate
A disciplined arena for rigorous argument, testing ideas through respectful opposition and clear logic.

## Drama
Embodied inquiry through performance, character, and scene—where ideas are explored in motion and voice.

## Salon
Our feminine, candlelit mode of learning—intimate, intuitive, and emotionally attuned. Explore the full program at `/programs/salon/`.
